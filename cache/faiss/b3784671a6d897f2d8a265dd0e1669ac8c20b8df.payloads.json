The probability of a galaxy to host a BBH is related to its properties, for example stellar mass and star formation rate. These properties can be estimated from observables, such as the luminosity in certain observation bands. We refer to this description of host galaxy properties as host galaxy weighting models. However, the host galaxy weighting model for BBHs has yet to be accurately determined. Population synthesis has provided a variety of host galaxy w", "alaxy weighting model for BBHs has yet to be accurately determined. Population synthesis has provided a variety of host galaxy weighting models. Here we investigate whether it is possible to distinguish different host galaxy weighting models using a data driven approach. We use the GW cosmology tool gwcosmo with a simulated IGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) fifth observing run (O5)-like observing scenario. We also construct a mock spectroscopic galaxy catalogue from MICECATv2. Our analysis compares the Bayes factors among three simple luminosity weighting models, r-band, g-band, and uniform weighting. The Bayes factors among different host galaxy weighting models show a minor preference for the true model for a ~200-detection case, and a decisive preference for the true model over the uniform model for a ~1000-detection case, which is strongly driven by a small number of well-localised events.\nComments:\n19 pages, 12 figures\nSubjects:\nCosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)\n; General Relativity and Quantum Co", "omments:\n19 pages, 12 figures\nSubjects:\nCosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)\n; General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)\nCite as:\narXiv:2508.15574\n[astro-ph.CO]\n(or\narXiv:2508.15574v1\n[astro-ph.CO]\nfor this version)\nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2508.15574\nFocus to learn more\narXiv-issued DOI via DataCite\nSubmission history\nFrom: Zhuotao Li [\nview email\n]\n[v1]\nThu, 21 Aug 2025 13:45:56 UTC (7,482 KB)\nFull-text links:\nAccess Paper:\nView a PDF of the paper titled Using gravitational wave dark sirens to choose between host galaxy weighting models, by Zhuotao Li and 2 other authors\nView PDF\nHTML (experimental)\nTeX Source\nOther Formats\nview license\nCurrent browse context:\nastro-ph.CO\n< prev\n|\nnext >\nnew\n|\nrecent\n|\n2025-08\nChange to browse by:\nastro-ph\ngr-qc\nReferences & Citations\nINSPIRE HEP\nNASA ADS\nGoogle Scholar\nSemantic Scholar\na\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibTeX formatted citation\n×\nloading...\nData provided by:\nBookmark\nBibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBiblio", "..\nBibTeX formatted citation\n×\nloading...\nData provided by:\nBookmark\nBibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer\n(\nWhat is the Explorer?\n)\nConnected Papers Toggle\nConnected Papers\n(\nWhat is Connected Papers?\n)\nLitmaps Toggle\nLitmaps\n(\nWhat is Litmaps?\n)\nscite.ai Toggle\nscite Smart Citations\n(\nWhat are Smart Citations?\n)\nCode, Data, Media\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv Toggle\nalphaXiv\n(\nWhat is alphaXiv?\n)\nLinks to Code Toggle\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n(\nWhat is CatalyzeX?\n)\nDagsHub Toggle\nDagsHub\n(\nWhat is DagsHub?\n)\nGotitPub Toggle\nGotit.pub\n(\nWhat is GotitPub?\n)\nHuggingface Toggle\nHugging Face\n(\nWhat is Huggingface?\n)\nLinks to Code Toggle\nPapers with Code\n(\nWhat is Papers with Code?\n)\nScienceCast Toggle\nScienceCast\n(\nWhat is ScienceCast?\n)\nDemos\nDemos\nReplicate Toggle\nReplicate\n(\nWhat is Replicate?\n)\nSpaces Toggle\nHugging Face Spaces\n(\nWhat is Spaces?\n)\nSpaces Toggle\nTXYZ.AI\n(\nWhat is TXYZ.AI?\n)\nRelated Papers\nR", "s Replicate?\n)\nSpaces Toggle\nHugging Face Spaces\n(\nWhat is Spaces?\n)\nSpaces Toggle\nTXYZ.AI\n(\nWhat is TXYZ.AI?\n)\nRelated Papers\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nLink to Influence Flower\nInfluence Flower\n(\nWhat are Influence Flowers?\n)\nCore recommender toggle\nCORE Recommender\n(\nWhat is CORE?\n)\nIArxiv recommender toggle\nIArxiv Recommender\n(\nWhat is IArxiv?\n)\nAuthor\nVenue\nInstitution\nTopic\nAbout arXivLabs\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?\nLearn more about arXivLabs\n.\nWhich authors of this paper are endorsers?\n|\nDisable MathJax\n(\nWhat is MathJax?\n)", "n more about arXivLabs\n.\nWhich authors of this paper are endorsers?\n|\nDisable MathJax\n(\nWhat is MathJax?\n)"]
