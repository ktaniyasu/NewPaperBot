The impact of climate change on small meteoroids has already been observed over the last two decades, with documented shifts in their ablation altitudes in the mesosphere (~50-85 km) and lower thermosphere (~85-120 km). This study evaluates the potential effect of these changes on meteorite-dropping fireballs, which typically penetrate the stratosphere (~10-50 km). As a case study, we simulate the atmospheric entry of the fragile Winchcombe carbonaceous chon", "ate the stratosphere (~10-50 km). As a case study, we simulate the atmospheric entry of the fragile Winchcombe carbonaceous chondrite under projected atmospheric conditions for the year 2100 assuming a moderate future emission scenario. Using a semi-empirical fragmentation and ablation model, we compare the meteoroid's light curve and deceleration under present and future atmospheric density profiles. The results indicate a modest variation of the ablation heights, with the catastrophic fragmentation occurring 300 m lower and the luminous flight terminating 190 m higher. The absolute magnitude peak remains unchanged, but the fireball would appear 0.5 dimmer above ~120 km. The surviving meteorite mass is reduced by only 0.1 g. Our findings indicate that century-scale variations in atmospheric density caused by climate change moderately influence bright fireballs and have a minimal impact on meteorite survival.\nComments:\nAccepted in Meteoritics & Planetary Science\nSubjects:\nEarth and Planetary Astrophysics (ast", "act on meteorite survival.\nComments:\nAccepted in Meteoritics & Planetary Science\nSubjects:\nEarth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)\nCite as:\narXiv:2508.19745\n[astro-ph.EP]\n(or\narXiv:2508.19745v1\n[astro-ph.EP]\nfor this version)\nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2508.19745\nFocus to learn more\narXiv-issued DOI via DataCite\nRelated DOI\n:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/MAPS.70046\nFocus to learn more\nDOI(s) linking to related resources\nSubmission history\nFrom: Eloy Peña-Asensio Dr. [\nview email\n]\n[v1]\nWed, 27 Aug 2025 10:19:18 UTC (816 KB)\nFull-text links:\nAccess Paper:\nView a PDF of the paper titled Century-Scale Effect of Climate Change on Meteorite Falls, by Eloy Pe\\~na-Asensio and 3 other authors\nView PDF\nHTML (experimental)\nTeX Source\nOther Formats\nview license\nCurrent browse context:\nastro-ph.EP\n< prev\n|\nnext >\nnew\n|\nrecent\n|\n2025-08\nChange to browse by:\nastro-ph\nReferences & Citations\nNASA ADS\nGoogle Scholar\nSemantic Scholar\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibTeX formatted citation\n×\nloading...\nData provided b", "ASA ADS\nGoogle Scholar\nSemantic Scholar\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibTeX formatted citation\n×\nloading...\nData provided by:\nBookmark\nBibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer\n(\nWhat is the Explorer?\n)\nConnected Papers Toggle\nConnected Papers\n(\nWhat is Connected Papers?\n)\nLitmaps Toggle\nLitmaps\n(\nWhat is Litmaps?\n)\nscite.ai Toggle\nscite Smart Citations\n(\nWhat are Smart Citations?\n)\nCode, Data, Media\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv Toggle\nalphaXiv\n(\nWhat is alphaXiv?\n)\nLinks to Code Toggle\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n(\nWhat is CatalyzeX?\n)\nDagsHub Toggle\nDagsHub\n(\nWhat is DagsHub?\n)\nGotitPub Toggle\nGotit.pub\n(\nWhat is GotitPub?\n)\nHuggingface Toggle\nHugging Face\n(\nWhat is Huggingface?\n)\nLinks to Code Toggle\nPapers with Code\n(\nWhat is Papers with Code?\n)\nScienceCast Toggle\nScienceCast\n(\nWhat is ScienceCast?\n)\nDemos\nDemos\nReplicate Toggle\nReplicate\n(\nWhat is Replicate?\n)\nSpaces Toggle\nHugging Face Spaces\n(\nWhat i", "\nWhat is ScienceCast?\n)\nDemos\nDemos\nReplicate Toggle\nReplicate\n(\nWhat is Replicate?\n)\nSpaces Toggle\nHugging Face Spaces\n(\nWhat is Spaces?\n)\nSpaces Toggle\nTXYZ.AI\n(\nWhat is TXYZ.AI?\n)\nRelated Papers\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nLink to Influence Flower\nInfluence Flower\n(\nWhat are Influence Flowers?\n)\nCore recommender toggle\nCORE Recommender\n(\nWhat is CORE?\n)\nIArxiv recommender toggle\nIArxiv Recommender\n(\nWhat is IArxiv?\n)\nAuthor\nVenue\nInstitution\nTopic\nAbout arXivLabs\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?\nLearn more about arXivLabs\n.\nWhich authors of this paper are ", "e an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?\nLearn more about arXivLabs\n.\nWhich authors of this paper are endorsers?\n|\nDisable MathJax\n(\nWhat is MathJax?\n)"]
